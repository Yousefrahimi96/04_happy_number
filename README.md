# Happy Number Checker

## Overview
This project is a simple Python program designed to determine whether a given number is a "Happy Number." A Happy Number is a number that eventually reaches 1 when you repeatedly replace it with the sum of the squares of its digits. If the process loops indefinitely without reaching 1, the number is not a Happy Number.

## Features
- Accepts an integer input from the user.
- Determines if the input is a Happy Number.
- Handles invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values) with an error message.
- Uses a set to detect cycles and prevent infinite loops.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.x is recommended).
2. Save the code in a file named `main.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing `main.py`.
5. Execute the program with the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
